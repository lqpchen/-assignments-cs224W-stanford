# README

This repo contains the assignments I'm doing for the 2021 version of [cs224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/), which compared to previous years devotes more towards Graph Neural Networks that is a fast evolving area and becoming increasingly popular recently. The classroom recordings are not available, but the lecturer has posted his self-made [recordings on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn) in April 2021 which have the same content following the same structure from the publicly available slides in a more concise way. 

The Colab assignments are tutorial like and give you hands-on experience with PyTorch Geometric and NetworkX. The Homework assignments involves more theoretical hand calculation which should strengthen your understanding more but are unfortunately not available for 2021.
